A game I am making to learn Unity!

This is a really simple tile based strategy game, similar to games like Fire Emblem. It was mostly inspired by a game called Into The Breach, which I thought would be really fun to try to recreate with different abilities for the playable units, so that's what I set out to do! Along with that, the project is mostly to really familiarize myself with game development via Unity, since it is the first solo project on Unity that I have done.

Five features I plan on adding:

- Units - At least five playable units, where three of the five units can be selected in a game

- Tiles - More tile variety, e.g., mud tiles which lower a unit's speed, lava tile which kills a unit when it's pushed into it

- Turns - Players can make a certain amount of "moves" each turn with their units, then the turn switches to the other player ***Completed!***

- Unit Selection Screen - Select the types of Units you want to use

- Better Graphics - Updated graphics that aren't just squares
